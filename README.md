# JS Helper Library
A set of light-weight functions that help in everyday's JS programming.

## Introduction
There is a set of functions that I used to recreate on most JS web programming projects. This library organizses these functions and provide better test coverage. These functions can be groups into these categories:
* Object functions: like check data type, travers object/array content, or deep equality check.
* String functions: like indexOf, startsWith, endsWith, all with case sensitivity control. Also there is a quick template replace function.
* Dom functions: find element by id or selector, simple attribute access, create and add element, and removeelements.
